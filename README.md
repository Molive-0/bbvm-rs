# bbvm-rs

A port of BBVM (https://github.com/Molive-0/bbvm) to rust

## new features
 * The compile native version now works if you have gcc installed. It seem to get confused with endianness however  
 * It now works on other architectures :)

## notes
Requires LLVM 12 to be available on the system.
